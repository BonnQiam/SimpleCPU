What is SimpleCPU?
---------------
SimpleCPU is a CPU design and verification platform with a bunch of design and verification tools / algorithms under its hood. SimpleCPU is aimed towards students and reserachers, helping them learn and easily carry out CPU simulations in an intuitive way. Being an open source project makes it easier for one to get an indepth understanding of the the underlying concepts by glossing at the source.

SimpleCPU focusses on the fundamentals. Everything has been written from scratch such as adders, logical operations, etc. 

Our future goals include a GUI tool to help easily build CPU and carry out simulations along with various performance numbers which would even help researchers on their projects.
