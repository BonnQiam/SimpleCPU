Instruction Set Simulator

The instruction set simulator is developed in C and supports the execution of the following instructions - 
<list the instructions>
The simulator provides support for the hex generator tool and also supports the testbench by providing
 various API calls through DPI support in system verilog. The source code is organised in the following 
manner
testbench/iss/src/ - contains the .c and .h files
testbench/iss/lib/ - contains the lib files required

Currently, the simulator processes each instruction by first decoding it to decide whether it is a R/I/J 
type instruction and then proceeds ahead with the execution by evaluating the case statement using 
either the opcode field value of the instruction or the function field value whichever is applicable. The 
simulator also supports the architecture register  dumps as well as the memory dump for a range of 
addresses. These utility functions help in the debugging process. 
Please go through the source code to understand more about the implementation technique. The 
current simulator supports MIPS instruction set and support for other instruction set simulators (ARM, 
x86) is in progress!
