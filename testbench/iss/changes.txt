List of changes done - 
The following paragraph details the changes made in the simulator. 
There were a whole lot of changes done in order to have the current implementation support 
co-simulation along with the RTL. 
The entire shell related functions were removed as other tools using the simulator would directly use either the run() or the go() functions. 

Various other utility functions were added to provide support for the hex generation tool and the C-DPI calls.
